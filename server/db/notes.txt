Would probably need these tables:
1. Airflow clusters: Containing data regarding airflow hosts: ip, and respective airflow folders. Maybe will also need keys for copying generated files
2. Templates: Contains DAG templates
3. DAG: actual dag data. Will be used to generate DAGs.
4. Users: if we want some sort of auth and permission levels
5. history tables: changes for some of the tables. Necessary for auditing
6.
